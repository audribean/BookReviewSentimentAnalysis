On average, women get lower ratings than men.

Women's reviews are more likely to have lower sentiment scores than men's.

Lower sentiment score in reviews is predictive of the female author's gender, and higher sentiment score in reviews is predictive of the male author's gender.

```{r}
data$rating <- as.numeric(as.character(data$rating))

  # Use the cmdstanr backend for Stan because it's faster and more modern than

summary(es_vs_rating_gender)
```

The sentiment decreases for female authors even the rating increases, whereas for male authors the sentiment increases as the rating increases.

```{r}
# TODO: make gender legend and rating on the x-axis

```{r}

  bf(rating ~ gender:SentimentGI),
  data = data,

summary(rating_vs_sentiment_gender)
```

For men, there is a weak association of positive sentiment and higher ratings, but for women thereâ€™s no association.
